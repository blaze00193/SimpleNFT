## Checkpoint 0: 📦 Environment 📚

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Then download the challenge to your computer and install dependencies by running:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges.git {challengeName}
cd {challengeName}
git checkout {challengeName}
yarn install
```

> in the same terminal, start your local network (a blockchain emulator in your computer):

```sh
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract (locally):

```sh
cd <challenge_folder_name>
yarn deploy
```

> in a third terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```sh
cd <challenge_folder_name>
yarn start
```

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

> 👩‍💻 Rerun `yarn deploy --reset` whenever you want to deploy new contracts to the frontend, update your current contracts with changes, or re-deploy it to get a fresh contract address.

🔏 Now you are ready to edit your smart contract `{mainContractName.sol}` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
